# NYPD-Nasty-YouTube-Playlist-Downloader

NYPD is a python script that lets you download an entire playlist and save it in a desired location in your PC.
You'll be needing chromedriver, selenium and pytube for this project.
Download chromedriver from here. https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Enter the download link in the way it appears below, i.e., enter the download link of the video and not the playlist.
